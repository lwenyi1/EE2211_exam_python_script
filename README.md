# Python Script for NUS EE2211 Exams

## Introduction
Just tossing all the functions I made to prepare for EE2211 midterms and finals out there. Hopefully someone finds this useful. Feel free to suggest any edits or highlight any parts of the script that don't work properly.

## Dependencies
Should have all the python packages specified by the course installed.

## Use
Download the module and import it into your own script. Or just directly use the downloaded script for your own working like some monster.
