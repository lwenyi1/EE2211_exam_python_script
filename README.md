# Python Script for NUS EE2211 Exams

## Introduction
Just tossing all the functions I made to prepare for EE2211 midterms and finals out there. Hopefully someone finds this useful.

## Dependencies
Should have all the python packages specified by the course installed.

## Use
Download the module and import it into your own script. Or just directly use the downloaded script for your own working like some monster.
